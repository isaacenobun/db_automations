  <em>A Repository of scripts that make your life easier as an Oracle DBA. Most of the scripts will be centered around monitoring and getting email alerts on different components of your db, while others will push the boundaries of actually trying to keep some aspects of the db on safe auto pilot.</em><br />
  Built with ❤️ for DBA's.
